    // Marks types as defined so that no-undef doesn't flag them. As far as I

    // Stylistic preference
    // "flowtype/generic-spacing": "off",

    // This is like no-dupe-keys but for flow types. Just like with
    // no-dupe-keys, it's not invalid to have them, but they're usually the
    // result of unfinished code reorganization, so it's useful for eslint to
    // point them out.

    // Subjective best-practice; some projects will use mutable arrays.
    // "flowtype/no-mutable-array": "off",

    // This rule forbids using Boolean, String and Number (which refer to the
    // wrapper types created by new Boolean(x), new String(x), and
    // new Number(x). Usually, you want boolean, string, and number instead
    // (which refer to the primitive types, eg true, "a", 4.2). This is almost
    // always true, but there can *technically* be times where you want to
    // refer to the wrapper types specifically for some reason. That said, it's
    // so uncommon, that this is probably a typo... so I'm kinda on the fence
    // about this one. I'm going to turn it off in the unobtrusive spirit of
    // staying out of the developer's way.

    // Even though some people could enable flow in every js file in their
    // project (without requiring the at-flow comment), this is pretty uncommon,
    // and it can be frustrating to try to debug why your types aren't flagging
    // incorrect code when you forgot to put an at-flow comment. So I'm going to
    // turn this one on as a warn, since it helps the user.

    // This rule can be used to enforce the presence and style of a @flow
    // comment. We don't use it for either of those things because not every
    // project uses flow comments, and enforcing the style (`/* @flow */` vs
    // `// @flow`) is a stylistic preference. However, it can also detect typos
    // like `@floww`. That's useful and in line with the goals of unobtrusive,
    // so warn when that happens.
